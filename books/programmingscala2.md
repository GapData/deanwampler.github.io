<p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033073.do">Programming Scala, Second Edition</a> is a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to <a href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a>. It covers the features of Scala version 2.11.</p>

<p>I wrote the book on Scala that I would want to read, if I were to start from the following background:
<ul>
<li>I'm an experienced developer of Enterprise or Internet, server-side applications.</li>
<li>I know Java and perhaps a few other languages.</li>
<li>I know Object-Oriented Programming, but not necessarily Functional Programming.</li>
<li>I hear that Functional Programming is the "future" and Scala is a natural migration step from Java.</li>
<li>I'm serious about learning Scala.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I would read <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033073.do">Programming Scala, Second Edition</a> to achieve the following:
<ul>
<li>Learn why Scala has become the language of choice for <em>data engineering</em> work in Big Data environments with tools like <a href="http://spark.apache.org">Spark</a> and <a href="http://kafka.apache.org">Kafka</a>.</li>
<li>Learn why Scala is an excellent language for state of the art microservices.</li>
<li>Learn the common idioms, libraries, tools, and techniques used by experts.</li>
<li>Master all the major features of Scala, warts and all.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you want a more gentle introduction to Scala, consider <a href="">Atomic Scala</a> and <a href="">Scala for the Impatient</a>.</p>

<p>I don't cover <em>everything</em> about the language and libraries. There are some more obscure topics that I omit and other very advanced topics that I briefly mention, so you'll be aware of them. Still, my goal for the reader is to <em>really</em> know the language, the common techniques used to solve various design problems, and to understand how Scala is used in domains like <em>Big Data</em>.</p>
