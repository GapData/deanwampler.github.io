        <p>Failure handling must be <em>first-class</em> in reactive systems, to satisfy the <em>resilient</em> trait. This talk discusses how reactive models and libraries support failure handling. Hint: Most only offer limited facilities. (November 19, 2014)</p>

        <p class="talk-desc"><a href="http://lambdajam.com/">LambdaJam Chicago</a></p>
        <p>I argue that <em>"Copious" Data</em> (okay, <em>Big Data</em>) is driving adoption of <em>Functional Programming</em> (FP), more so than multicore concurrency concerns, because more developers will grapple with data problems than concurrency. Because FP is based on Mathematics, it is a natural fit for working with Data, whereas languages like Java, in which Hadoop is written, are poor choices. (November 21, 2013)</p>

        <p>Relational databases fell out of fashion with the rise of <em>NoSQL</em> and <em>Hadoop</em>.

I criticized the <em>MapReduce</em> programming model and the technical limitations of the <em>Hadoop</em> implementation, in particular. In part, I argued that Java (pre Java-8 especially) is the wrong tool for developing <em>Big Data</em> applications and middleware. Instead, we should be using <em>Functional Programming</em>, since when we work with data, we are really doing <em>Mathematics</em>! (April 11, 2013)</p>

<p class="talk-small-description">Big Data is at a crossroads, where Hadoop is showing its age and new compute models are emerging. NoSQL databases are adding query engines, sometimes based on SQL and <span class="keyword">NewSQL</span> databases are bringing some measure of NoSQL performance to relational models. This talk examines these trends, focusing mostly on Hadoop today and tomorrow.

<h3>Modern Approaches to Software Development</h3>

A few years after I started my evolution from thinking in objects to thinking in functions, it occurred to me that our ideas of what's good and bad in software development have often changed. Today's dogma is tomorrow's heresy, if you will. So, I gave a talk on this idea at <a href="http://thestrangeloop.com">Strange Loop 2011</a> and subsequently in other venues.</p>

<p><a href="HeresiesAndDogmasInSoftwareDevelopment.pdf">Heresies And Dogmas In Software Development</a> <img src="/assets/images/page_white_acrobat.png" alt="Adobe PDF" /> <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Heresies-and-Dogmas-in-Software-Development">Strange Loop 2011 Video</a> (Yea, I know I used Comic Sans in that version...)</p>

<p class="talk-small-description">Five ideas in the history of software development that were once (or still are) popular, but now are (usually) seen as obsolete (plus a "bonus" topic). The video of the Strange Loop talk is on <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Heresies-and-Dogmas-in-Software-Development">InfoQ</a>.</p>

<p>I've done a series of talks on the theme of <i>Polyglot and Poly-Paradigm Programming</i>, where I discuss how using multiple languages and/or "paradigms" can simplify the solutions to common problems we encounter today in software developer.</p>

<h3>General AOSD</h3>

<p><a href="AOP_Academia_and_Industry.pdf">AOP in Academia and Industry</a> <img src="/assets/images/page_white_acrobat.png" alt="Adobe PDF" /></p>
<p class="talk-small-description">I discuss some of the academic research and industry trends that led to the creation of AOP, the current state of things, and how both can contribute to the future development of AOP and emerging technologies that might use it.</p>

<p><a href="AOPIntroAndPrinciplesTalk.pdf">Aspect-Oriented Programming and Design for Java and AspectJ</a> <img src="/assets/images/page_white_acrobat.png" alt="Adobe PDF" /></p>
<p class="talk-small-description">This is an introduction to AOP, given as a presentation at the Chicago Java User's Group, Sept. 6, 2007. I discuss why AOP is interesting, what problems it solves, followed by a look at how aspects can be implemented in AspectJ and Spring AOP. I then look at several object-oriented design principles adapted to aspects and, along the way, demonstrate fine-grained separation of concerns using AspectJ.</p>

<p><a href="http://aosd.net/2007/program/industry/I6-AspectDesignPrinciples.pdf">Aspect-Oriented Design Principles: Lessons from Object-Oriented Design</a> (<img src="/assets/images/page_white_acrobat.png" alt="Adobe PDF" /> on the AOSD 2007 Conference <a href="http://aosd.net/2007/">web site</a>).</p>
<p class="talk-small-description">An examination of 11, well-established
OOD principles and how they apply to AOD. The main objective
of this paper is to address pragmatic issues of designing <i>production-quality</i> aspect-based software. In today's world, aspects
won't prosper unless they promote agility, reusability, and maintainability. The 11 OOD principles discussed have proven to be effective
design tools that promote these qualities (especially in languages like Java, C#, C/C++, <i>etc.</i>). I discuss how the principles apply to aspect software, how AOD refines them, and how they lead to new aspect-specific extensions that promote better aspect design.
This paper is part of the Industry Track at AOSD 2007 in Vancouver, BC.</p>

<p class="talk-small-description">An introduction to <a href="/contract4j">Contract4J</a> and how to use it. The article also
briefly discusses some emerging ideas about the nature of interfaces in Aspect-Oriented Design, and how
Contract4J demonstrates some of those ideas.</p>

<p class="talk-small-description">Writing <a href="/contract4j">Contract4J</a> revealed many of the challenges faced when
trying to write generic, reusable aspects in AspectJ. This paper discusses those challenges, how they
were addressed, and offers suggestions for improvements to AspectJ and our concepts of AOD that will
make it easier to write reusable aspects. Presented at the <a href="http://aosd.net/2006/industry/index.php">Industry Track</a>, AOSD 2006, Bonn Germany, March 22, 2006

<p class="talk-small-description"><a href="/contract4j">Contract4J</a> comes in two forms; an implementation where contract
tests are defined using Java 5 annotations and a more experimental implementation where the tests are
defined as regular Java methods with a JavaBeans-like naming convention. This paper discusses how these two
forms define a protocol with two different syntaxes that allow aspects to advice objects with minimal
coupling, in the spirit of interface design. Presented at the
<a href="http://www.aosd.net/workshops/acp4is/2006/papers.html">ACP4IS Workshop</a> at AOSD 2006, Bonn Germany, March 21, 2006.</p>
