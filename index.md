I am a software developer specializing in *Big Data* applications using Spark, Hadoop, Mesos, and other tools. I've been a long-time advocate for *Functional Programming* and Scala as ideal tools for data-centric applications.

I work for [Typesafe](http://typesafe.com). I write books for O'Reilly. I help organize and speak frequently at conferences around the world. I organize several user groups in Chicago, where I live.

I am the author of [Programming Scala, Second Edition](programmingscala2.html) and [Functional Programming for Java Developers](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449311032/). I'm the co-author with Edward Capriolo and Jason Rutherglen of [Programming Hive](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449319335/). All are published by [O'Reilly Media](http://oreilly.com).

My conference talks can be found at [Polyglot Programming](http://polyglotprogramming.com/talks). Some are also on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/deanwampler/).

I started the [Chicago-Area Scala Enthusiasts](http://meetup.com/chicagoscala) and I help organize the [Chicago Hadoop User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-area-Hadoop-User-Group-CHUG/) and the [Chicago Spark Users](http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Spark-Users/).

You'll find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/deanwampler) and I occasionally [blog](http://blog.polyglotprogramming.com).

For more on my background, see my [resum&eacute;](resume.pdf) <img src="/assets/images/page_white_acrobat.png" alt="Adobe PDF"/> and my [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/deanwampler/) account.

I inflict my photography on unsuspecting conference attendees. You can find more of it at [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/deanwampler).
