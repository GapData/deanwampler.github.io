    <h2>Polyglot Programming</h2>
    <p>Polyglot Programming is a website dedicated to exploring the benefits (and drawbacks) of combining multiple programming languages and multiple "modularity paradigms" in application development. The "paradigms" include Functional Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, and Aspect-Oriented Programming.</p>

    <h2>Aspect Oriented Programming</h2>
    <p>AOP is an attempt to address <em>cross cutting concerns</em> in applications. The dominant decomposition into modules usually reflects the domain model or perhaps the implementation infrastructure. However, it becomes difficult to add in globally-consistent features, like logging, that cut across these module boundaries. AOP attempts to solve this problem.</p>

    <h1>Error Handling in Reactive Systems</h1>
    <p class="talk-desc"><a href="http://reactconf.com/">React Conf San Francisco 2014</a></p>
    <p>Failure handling must be "first-class" in reactive systems, to satisfy the resilient trait. This talk for React SF 2014 discusses how reactive models and libraries support failure handling. Hint: Most only offer limited facilities. (November 19, 2014)</p>
