<span class="keyword">Concurrent Thought</span> is a stealth startup working on <span class="keyword">Big Data</span> tools reflecting the evolving state of hardware, cloud and other virtualization trends, as well as our current understanding of optimal computing strategies for streaming and batch-mode applications.

<span class="keyword">Concurrent Thought</span> was started by [Dean Wampler, Ph.D.](http://deanwampler.com). Dean has been [cited](http://analyticsweek.com/top-200-thought-leaders-in-bigdata-analytics/) as one of the most influential people in the <span class="keyword">Big Data</span> ecosystem, in large part because of his many talks at conferences, which are available at [polyglotprogramming.com](http://www.polyglotprogramming.com/papers).
